Description:
The Network Operations team needs a web, or windows application to allow them to manage various "network nodes". 

Primary criteria:
* Ensure the user can add/remove nodes to the network.
* Ensure the user can bring individual nodes online/offline.
* Ensure the user can see the online/offline status of nodes.
* Ensure all of the metrics of a node are displayed to the user.
* Ensure maximum threshold values can be set for metrics.
* Ensure a visual alarm is displayed when any of the metrics exceed maximum limits.

Bonus criteria suggestions (any/all/none):
* UI: Everyone likes eye-candy.  Make the UI slick and intuitive.
* UI: Sometimes users are on-the-go.  Add some way for them to view on a mobile device
* UI: Nodes are all deployed to a geographical location.  
* Logic: The random metrics are static.  Have the metrics update regularly
* General: Improve the NodeManager - Consider things like: performance, error handling, daylight savings
* General: Increase unit test code coverage
* Network: Some of our external partners would like to use this functionality.  Expose the application logic through WCF or REST service
* ???: Surprise us :).

Additional Notes:
* This is a simulated problem.  No physical network nodes exist to be used.
* Use best practices in your design and coding.
* Interfaces and classes have been provided as a starting point.
* Third Party APIs, libraries, frameworks and services may be leveraged (e.g., Google, Bing etc.,), but they must be legal, and accessible by us.
